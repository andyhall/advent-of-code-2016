## My #AdventOfCode solutions for 2016.

----

All in Javascript/Node. I added `webpack` rigging this year,
so as to get dynamic reloading, browser debug tools, &c.

To install

 1. Clone this repo
 2. `cd advent-of-code-2016`
 3. `npm install`

To run in a terminal:

 1. Edit `day.txt`
 2. `npm run local`

To run in the browser:

 1. `npm install -g webpack webpack-dev-server`
 2. `npm start`
 3. Open `localhost:8081`
 4. Edit `day.txt`
